# Chapter 4: Object-Oriented Analysis Fundamentals

**Course:** SA2025 - Software Analysis and Design  
**Chapter Duration:** 6-7 hours (4 hours instruction + 2-3 hours hands-on)  
**Prerequisites:** Chapter 3 - Use Case Modeling and User Stories

---

## 📋 Chapter Overview

Welcome to Chapter 4! Now that you'vae modeled **how users interact with the system** through use cases, it's time to identify **what objects exist in the system** and how they relate to each other. This chapter bridges the gap between behavioral requirements and system design by teaching you to:

- Think in objects: identify real-world entities as software components
- Apply core OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Extract objects and classes from use cases and requirements
- Model relationships between classes (association, aggregation, composition)
- Create domain models that capture business concepts
- Apply SOLID principles for maintainable design

**Why This Matters:**
- Object-oriented analysis is the foundation of modern software development
- Domain models help stakeholders and developers share a common understanding
- Good OOA leads to flexible, maintainable, and testable code
- These skills are essential for any software development career path
- Employers expect analysts to produce class diagrams and domain models

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

1. **Think real-world first** - Objects should represent real concepts
2. **Start with nouns** - Requirements nouns are candidate classes
3. **Keep classes focused** - One responsibility per class
4. **Model behavior, not just data** - Classes need methods, not just attributes
5. **Use CRC cards** - Physical cards help in collaborative sessions
6. **Iterate your model** - First attempts are rarely perfect
7. **Validate with stakeholders** - They understand the domain best
