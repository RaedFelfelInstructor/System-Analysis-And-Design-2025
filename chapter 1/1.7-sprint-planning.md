# 1.7 Sprint Planning Workshop

[← Previous: 1.6 Case Study](./1.6-school-system-case-study.md) | [Back to README](./chapter-01-README.md) | [Next: 1.8 Tools & Practices →](./1.8-tools-and-practices.md)

## 📖 Introduction

You've learned the theory of sprint planning, and you understand our School Management System project. Now it's time to see how theory becomes practice. In this section, we'll plan the entire 16-week development project, sprint by sprint.

You'll see exactly how to break down a real project, estimate user stories, create sprint goals, and build a realistic delivery timeline. This is the blueprint that guides the development team from concept to production.

**Reading Time:** 35 minutes  
**Activity Time:** 20 minutes

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. Break down a project into sprint-sized increments
2. Write effective user stories with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate user stories using story points
4. Create meaningful sprint goals
5. Sequence work to manage dependencies
6. Balance must-have vs. nice-to-have features
7. Plan for technical infrastructure and non-functional work
8. Create a realistic product backlog

## 🎓 Hands-On Activity: Create Your Sprint Plan

### Activity: "Plan Your Own Sprint"

**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Format:** Individual or small groups

**Scenario:**
You're planning Sprint 8 (post-launch enhancements). The Product Owner has these requests:

**Requested Features:**
1. Mobile app (native iOS/Android)
2. Automated report card generation
3. Grade trending and analytics
4. Student behavior tracking
5. Library management integration
6. Payment processing for fees
7. Advanced scheduling (block schedules)
8. Teacher evaluation module

**Your Constraints:**
- Team velocity: 40 points/sprint
- Sprint duration: 2 weeks
- Must prioritize based on value and dependencies

**Your Tasks:**

**Step 1: Estimate Each Feature (5 minutes)**

| Feature | Complexity | Uncertainty | Estimated Points |
|---------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Mobile app | | | ___ |
| Report cards | | | ___ |
| Grade analytics | | | ___ |
| Behavior tracking | | | ___ |
| Library integration | | | ___ |
| Payment processing | | | ___ |
| Advanced scheduling | | | ___ |
| Teacher evaluation | | | ___ |

**Step 2: Prioritize (5 minutes)**

Use MoSCoW method:
- Must Have: _______________
- Should Have: _______________
- Could Have: _______________
- Won't Have (this sprint): _______________

**Step 3: Create Sprint Goal (5 minutes)**

Write a compelling sprint goal:
________________________________
________________________________

**Step 4: Select Stories (5 minutes)**

Which features will you include to stay within 40 points?

Selected for Sprint 8:
1. _________________ (__ points)
2. _________________ (__ points)
3. _________________ (__ points)
4. _________________ (__ points)

Total: ___ points

**Debrief Questions:**
1. How did you decide what to include/exclude?
2. What dependencies did you consider?
3. How does your Sprint Goal guide selection?
4. What would you tell the Product Owner about the features you didn't include?

## 🔑 Key Concepts Summary

### Critical Sprint Planning Principles

1. **Sprint Goals Drive Selection**
   - Not just "complete X points"
   - Meaningful, cohesive objective
   - Guides daily decisions

2. **Story Points Are Relative**
   - 5 points means ~5x effort of 1 point story
   - Team-specific scale
   - Includes all work (code, test, review, deploy)

3. **Dependencies Matter**
   - Can't do grades without users
   - Can't do parent portal without grades
   - Sequence thoughtfully

4. **Velocity Stabilizes Over Time**
   - Sprint 1-2: Learning, establishing baseline
   - Sprint 3-5: Velocity stabilizes
   - Sprint 6+: Predictable capacity

5. **Buffer Is Essential**
   - 10-20% buffer for unknowns
   - Sprint 7 intentionally flexible
   - Better to under-promise, over-deliver

### Sprint Planning Checklist

```
Before Sprint Planning:
□ Product Backlog refined and prioritized
□ Top stories have acceptance criteria
□ Technical dependencies identified
□ Team capacity known (holidays, vacations)
□ Sprint goal ideas prepared

During Sprint Planning:
□ Sprint goal defined and agreed
□ Stories selected based on goal and velocity
□ Each story estimated and understood
□ Tasks identified for complex stories
□ Dependencies and risks discussed
□ Definition of Done reviewed
□ Team commits to Sprint Backlog

After Sprint Planning:
□ Sprint Backlog created and visible
□ Sprint goal communicated to stakeholders
□ First stories ready to start
□ Daily Scrum scheduled
□ Sprint Review and Retro scheduled
```

## ✅ Self-Check Questions

Test your understanding:

1. Why did we start with Sprint 0 (Foundation) before feature development?
2. What is the Sprint Goal for Sprint 3 and how does it guide story selection?
3. Why is Sprint 2 slightly over-committed (42 points), and what should the team do?
4. How many total story points are planned across all 7 sprints?
5. Which sprint delivers the most critical user-facing value? Why?
6. What is the purpose of making Sprint 7 flexible/over-committed?
7. Why must US-018 (Enroll Students) come after US-016 (Create Classes)?
8. How does the burn-up chart help track project progress?
