- Highest and lowest explain reasoning
- Team discusses
- Identify what's unclear

Step 6: Re-estimate if needed
- Repeat until consensus (typically 1-2 rounds)

Step 7: Record estimate
```

**Estimation Template:**

| Story | Round 1 Votes | Discussion Points | Final Estimate |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|

### Special Cards Explained

```
?: "I don't understand this story"
   → Triggers discussion to clarify

☕: "This is too large to estimate"
   → Story needs to be broken down

0: "This is already done"
   → Confirm with team

100: "This is impossibly large"
   → Epic-level, must split
```

### Common Estimation Mistakes

```
❌ DON'T:
- Estimate in hours during poker
- Let one person dominate
- Pressure for consensus too quickly
- Estimate stories you don't understand
- Use non-Fibonacci numbers

✅ DO:
- Estimate relative to reference stories
- Listen to all perspectives
- Ask clarifying questions
- Break down stories that are too large
- Re-estimate if new information emerges
```

### Debrief Questions

1. What caused the biggest estimation differences?
2. Which stories were hardest to estimate? Why?
3. How did discussion change your initial estimate?
4. What information would help you estimate more accurately?
5. How would you handle persistent disagreement?

    style D fill:#ffcc80
```

### Anti-Pattern Scenarios

**Scenario 1: The Status Report**
```
❌ BAD:
Carlos: "I worked on the notification service yesterday. 
I spent 2 hours debugging the email integration, then 
1 hour setting up the queue system, and another hour 
writing documentation. Today I'll continue with..."

[Goes on for 5 minutes, loses team's attention]

✅ GOOD:
Carlos: "Yesterday: Made progress on notifications but hit 
a technical decision point. Today: Need 15 minutes after 
standup to discuss architecture. Blocker: Need team input 
on websockets vs email queue."
```

**Scenario 2: Problem Solving**
```
❌ BAD:
[During standup]
Carlos: "I can't decide between websockets and email queue"
Alice: "Well, websockets are real-time but..."
Bob: "But email is more reliable because..."
[30 minutes later, still discussing]

✅ GOOD:
Scrum Master: "That's important but let's take it offline. 
Carlos, Alice, Bob - can you stay for 15 minutes after? 
Let's continue the standup."
```

**Scenario 3: The Absent Member**
```
❌ BAD:
Scrum Master: "Anyone heard from Diana?"
[Crickets]
[Move on, Diana's work unknown]

✅ GOOD:
Scrum Master: "Diana is out today. Bob, you paired with 
her yesterday - can you give her update?"
Bob: "She was testing US-024, found 3 bugs, logged them. 
She'll retest when Alice fixes them."
```

### Debrief Questions

1. What made the standup effective or ineffective?
2. How did the Scrum Master keep it on track?
3. What actions emerged from the standup?
4. Which impediments needed immediate attention?
5. How would you handle a team member who consistently goes over time?

🚢 Boat = Team
⛵ Wind = What helped us (propelled forward)
⚓ Anchor = What slowed us (held back)
🏝️ Island = Sprint Goal (destination)
🌊 Rocks = Risks ahead (dangers to avoid)
```

**Instructions:**
1. Draw sailboat diagram
2. Team adds items to each category
3. Discuss patterns and actions

**Example:**

```
⛵ WIND (Helping):
- Product Owner responsiveness
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Pair programming success
- Good test coverage

⚓ ANCHOR (Slowing):
- Production bugs (interruptions)
- Email service unreliable
- Technical debt in auth module
- New framework learning curve

🏝️ ISLAND (Goal):
- Reached 34/37 points (92%)
- Attendance tracking working
- Parent notifications working (mostly)
- Quality good despite issues

🌊 ROCKS (Risks Ahead):
- Email service still unstable
- Growing technical debt
- Holiday season coming (reduced availability)
- Integration with new payment system next sprint
```

**Actions From Sailboat:**
```
1. Address email service: Research alternatives this week
2. Plan tech debt sprint: Dedicate 20% of next sprint to refactoring
3. Holiday planning: Update capacity for Sprint 5 planning
4. Payment integration: Research and create spike story
```

### Creating SMART Action Items

```
❌ BAD Action Items:
- "Communicate better"
- "Fix technical debt"
- "Improve code quality"
- "Be more agile"

✅ GOOD Action Items (SMART):
- [Carlos] Research 3 backup email providers by Wednesday, present options
- [Team] Dedicate 8 story points (20%) of Sprint 5 to refactoring auth module
- [Alice] Create code review checklist and share by Tuesday
- [Scrum Master] Block calendar for daily focus time (9-11am, 2-4pm)
```

**SMART Criteria:**
```
Specific: What exactly will be done?
Measurable: How will we know it's complete?
Assignable: Who owns it?
Realistic: Can it actually be done?
Time-bound: By when?
```

### Debrief Questions

1. Which retrospective technique was most effective? Why?
2. How did visualization (sailboat) help discussion?
3. Were action items specific enough?
4. How would you ensure action items are actually completed?

## 🎯 Activity 7: Requirements Workshop

### Objective
Practice eliciting and documenting requirements from stakeholders.

### Duration
30 minutes

### Setup

**Roles:**
- Stakeholder: Teacher (1 person)
- Business Analyst: Requirements gatherer (1 person)
- Observers: Take notes (remaining participants)

### Scenario

**Context:**
You're gathering requirements for a new "Assignment Management" feature for the School Management System.

**Stakeholder Profile:**
```
Name: Ms. Jennifer Martinez
Role: 8th Grade English Teacher
Experience: 15 years teaching
Tech Comfort: Medium
Current Process: Paper-based assignment tracking
Pain Points: Loses assignments, unclear due dates, no parent visibility
```

### Interview Script

**Business Analyst Tasks:**
1. Understand current process
2. Identify pain points
3. Elicit requirements
4. Clarify ambiguity
5. Prioritize needs

**Sample Questions:**
```
Process Understanding:
- "Walk me through how you currently assign homework"
- "How do students submit assignments?"
- "How do you grade and return assignments?"

Pain Point Discovery:
- "What's most frustrating about the current process?"
- "How much time do you spend managing assignments weekly?"
- "What do students complain about most?"

Requirements Elicitation:
- "What would make assignment management easier?"
- "How would you like to communicate due dates?"
- "What information do parents need to see?"

Prioritization:
- "If you could only have three features, what would they be?"
- "What's absolutely essential vs. nice-to-have?"
```

### Stakeholder Responses (Script)

```
Current Process:
"I write assignments on the board, students copy them down. 
Half the students forget or lose the information. Parents 
have no idea what's due until report cards. I collect paper 
assignments, which often get lost in my bag. Grading takes 
forever because I have to track down missing work."

Pain Points:
"I spend 5 hours per week just tracking assignments - who 
turned in what, who's late, contacting parents about missing 
work. Students claim they 'didn't know' about assignments. 
Parents email me asking what's due. I have no automated way 
to handle this."

Dream Features:
"I want to post assignments online with due dates. Students 
should see what's due, what they've submitted, their grades. 
Parents should get notifications about upcoming due dates 
and missing work. I want to grade electronically and return 
feedback quickly."
```
