## 📖 Introduction

Scrum is the most popular Agile framework in the world. According to the 2023 State of Agile report, 87% of Agile teams use Scrum or a Scrum hybrid. But Scrum is often misunderstood—many teams say they "do Scrum" but only follow parts of it.

In this section, we'll explore Scrum in depth: its structure, roles, events, artifacts, and practices. You'll learn not just WHAT Scrum is, but WHY it works and HOW to apply it effectively.

**Reading Time:** 40 minutes  
**Activity Time:** 20 minutes

## 🏉 What is Scrum?

### Definition

**Scrum** is a lightweight framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products through iterative and incremental practices.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Timeboxed iterations called "Sprints"
- Cross-functional, self-organizing teams
- Regular inspection and adaptation
- Focus on delivering working software
- Empirical process control

### Scrum Theory: Three Pillars

    style B fill:#81c784
    style C fill:#81c784
    style D fill:#81c784
    style I fill:#66bb6a
```

#### Transparency
- All work is visible to everyone
- Common definition of "Done"
- Shared understanding of work items
- Open communication

#### Inspection
- Sprint Review: Inspect product increment
- Sprint Retrospective: Inspect process
- Daily Scrum: Inspect daily progress
- Backlog Refinement: Inspect requirements

#### Adaptation
- Adjust plan based on inspection
- Change approach if not working
- Continuous improvement
- Respond to feedback quickly

### Product Owner (PO)

#### Core Responsibility
**Maximize the value of the product and the work of the Development Team.**

#### Key Activities

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Product<br/>Owner))
    Backlog Management
      Create user stories
      Prioritize items
      Refine requirements
      Accept/reject work
    Stakeholder Liaison
      Gather requirements
      Communicate vision
      Manage expectations
      Report progress
    ROI Focus
      Business value
      Market analysis
      Competitive positioning
      Budget awareness
    Availability
      Answer questions
      Provide clarifications
      Make decisions quickly
      Attend all ceremonies
```

#### Detailed Responsibilities

**1. Product Backlog Management**
- Create and maintain the Product Backlog
- Clearly express Product Backlog items
- Order items to best achieve goals
- Optimize value of Development Team's work
- Ensure backlog is visible, transparent, and clear

**Example - School Management System:**

```
Product Owner's Prioritization:
1. Authentication (Must Have) - No system without login
2. Attendance Tracking (Must Have) - Core daily operation
3. Grade Entry (Must Have) - Essential academic function
4. Parent Portal (Should Have) - Important but system works without
5. Advanced Analytics (Could Have) - Nice enhancement
```

**2. Stakeholder Management**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[School Principal] --> PO[Product Owner]
    B[Teachers] --> PO
    C[Parents] --> PO
    D[Students] --> PO
    E[IT Department] --> PO
    F[School Board] --> PO
    
    PO --> G[Single Voice]
    G --> H[Development Team]
    
    style PO fill:#2196f3
    style G fill:#64b5f6
    style H fill:#4caf50
```

**Why Single Product Owner?**
- Avoids conflicting priorities
- Clear decision-making
- Accountability for outcomes
- Consistent vision

**3. Acceptance Criteria Definition**

**Example User Story with Acceptance Criteria:**

```
User Story: US-019 Record Attendance

As a teacher
I want to quickly record student attendance
So that I can track attendance patterns

Acceptance Criteria:
✓ Teacher can see list of students in their class
✓ Teacher can mark students as Present, Absent, Late, or Excused
✓ Bulk selection available (e.g., "Mark all present")
✓ Changes save immediately
✓ Attendance timestamp recorded automatically
✓ Parents notified of absences within 1 hour
✓ Teacher can edit attendance for up to 24 hours
✓ System prevents duplicate attendance records
✓ Works on both desktop and tablet
✓ Complete workflow takes less than 2 minutes for 30 students
```

#### Product Owner Anti-Patterns

❌ **Common Mistakes:**

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Unavailable PO** | Team blocked waiting for decisions | Dedicated PO, 20+ hours/week |
| **PO by Committee** | Multiple people acting as PO | Single accountable PO |
| **Proxy PO** | PO doesn't have authority | Empower PO to make decisions |
| **Tech Lead as PO** | Technical focus over business value | Business-focused PO |
| **Micromanaging** | Tells team HOW to build | Focus on WHAT and WHY |

#### Product Owner Skills

### Development Team

#### Core Responsibility
**Turn Product Backlog items into a potentially shippable Increment of product.**

#### Team Characteristics

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Development Team] --> B[Self-Organizing]
    A --> C[Cross-Functional]
    A --> D[No Sub-Teams]
    A --> E[Collective Ownership]

    style F fill:#81c784
    style G fill:#81c784
    style H fill:#81c784
    style I fill:#81c784
```

#### Optimal Team Size

**3-9 People (Scrum Guide)**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Too Small<br/>1-2 people] --> B[Limited Skills<br/>Low Productivity]
    
    C[Optimal<br/>3-9 people] --> D[Cross-Functional<br/>Self-Sufficient<br/>Good Communication]
    
    E[Too Large<br/>10+ people] --> F[Coordination Overhead<br/>Communication Issues<br/>Decreased Agility]
    
    style A fill:#ef5350
    style C fill:#4caf50
    style E fill:#ff9800
```

**Why 3-9?**
- **Minimum 3:** Need diversity of skills
- **Maximum 9:** Communication complexity grows exponentially
- **Sweet Spot 5-7:** Most effective size

**Communication Channels Formula:**
```
Channels = n(n-1)/2
3 people = 3 channels
5 people = 10 channels
7 people = 21 channels
9 people = 36 channels
15 people = 105 channels (too many!)
```

#### Cross-Functional Skills

**School System Development Team Example:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Development Team<br/>7 People] --> B[Frontend Developer<br/>React Expert]
    A --> C[Backend Developer<br/>Node.js/API]
    A --> D[Full-Stack Developer<br/>Both Frontend/Backend]
    A --> E[QA Engineer<br/>Testing Specialist]
    A --> F[UI/UX Designer<br/>Design Skills]
    A --> G[Database Specialist<br/>MySQL Expert]
    A --> H[DevOps Engineer<br/>Infrastructure/Deployment]
    
    I[Can Deliver<br/>Complete Features<br/>Independently] --> A
    
    style A fill:#4caf50
    style I fill:#81c784
```

**T-Shaped Skills:**

    A[T-Shaped Developer] --> B[Deep Expertise<br/>in 1-2 areas<br/>Vertical bar of T]
    A --> C[Basic Competence<br/>across many areas<br/>Horizontal bar of T]
    
    B --> D[Example:<br/>Expert in React]
    C --> E[Can do:<br/>Backend, Testing,<br/>Database, DevOps]
    
    style A fill:#2196f3
    style D fill:#64b5f6
    style E fill:#90caf9
```

#### Development Team Responsibilities

**1. Deliver Increment**
- Build working software each sprint
- Meet Definition of Done
- Quality is non-negotiable
- No "undone" work carried over

**2. Self-Organization**
- Decide HOW to do the work
- Choose technical approaches
- Distribute tasks among themselves
- Manage their own work

**3. Cross-Train**
- Share knowledge continuously
- Pair programming
- Code reviews
- Documentation

**4. Participate in All Events**
- Sprint Planning: Commit to sprint goal
- Daily Scrum: Synchronize work
- Sprint Review: Demo increment
- Sprint Retrospective: Improve process

#### Development Team Anti-Patterns

❌ **Common Mistakes:**

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Siloed Specialists** | "Not my job" mentality | Encourage T-shaped skills |
| **Hero Culture** | One person knows everything | Knowledge sharing, pairing |
| **No Shared Ownership** | Individual code ownership | Collective code ownership |
| **Cherry Picking** | Only taking easy tasks | Team commits together |
| **Quality Shortcuts** | Technical debt accumulates | Maintain Definition of Done |

### Event 1: The Sprint

#### Overview

**The Sprint** is a timebox during which a "Done", usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fixed duration (2-4 weeks, typically 2 weeks)
- New Sprint starts immediately after previous one
- No gaps between Sprints
- No changes that endanger Sprint Goal

#### Sprint Timebox

```

#### Sprint Cancellation

**When to Cancel:**
- Sprint Goal becomes obsolete
- Market conditions change dramatically
- Organization changes direction

**Who Can Cancel:**
- Only the Product Owner
- Rare occurrence (should be exceptional)

**Impact:**
- Completed work reviewed for acceptance
- Incomplete work re-estimated and put back on backlog
- Time and resources wasted

---

### Event 2: Sprint Planning

#### Purpose
**Plan the work to be performed in the Sprint.**

#### Duration
- **2-week sprint:** 4 hours maximum
- **4-week sprint:** 8 hours maximum
- **Formula:** Sprint length (weeks) × 2 hours

#### Two-Part Agenda

```mermaid

    style A fill:#fff9c4
    style B fill:#64b5f6
    style C fill:#81c784
```

#### Part 1: What Can Be Done?

**Inputs:**
- Product Backlog (prioritized)
- Latest product Increment
- Projected capacity of Development Team
- Past performance (velocity)

**Activities:**

**1. Review Top Backlog Items**

```
Product Owner presents top items:
1. US-019: Record attendance (8 points)
2. US-020: View attendance history (5 points)
3. US-021: Edit attendance (5 points)
4. US-022: Attendance reports (8 points)
5. US-023: Student view attendance (3 points)
```

**2. Determine Team Capacity**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Team of 7] --> B[14 days available]
    B --> C[Minus holidays: 1 day]
    C --> D[Minus training: 0.5 day]
    D --> E[12.5 days × 7 people]
    E --> F[87.5 person-days]
    
    F --> G[Historical velocity:<br/>40 story points]
    
    style G fill:#4caf50
```

**3. Select Items**

Team discusses each item and selects based on:
- Priority (PO guidance)
- Capacity (velocity)
- Dependencies
- Sprint Goal alignment

**4. Create Sprint Goal**

**Good Sprint Goals:**
- ✅ "Enable teachers to track and manage attendance"
- ✅ "Parents can view their child's grades in real-time"
- ✅ "Complete user authentication and authorization"

**Bad Sprint Goals:**
- ❌ "Complete 40 story points"
- ❌ "Work on high-priority items"
- ❌ "Fix bugs and add features"

**Why Sprint Goals Matter:**

### Event 3: Daily Scrum (Daily Standup)

#### Purpose
**Inspect progress toward Sprint Goal and adapt Sprint Backlog as necessary.**

#### Format

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Daily Scrum<br/>15 Minutes<br/>Same Time & Place] --> B[Each Team Member<br/>Answers:]
    
    B --> C[1. What did I do<br/>yesterday?]

    D --> F
    E --> F
    
    F --> G[Synchronization<br/>& Planning]
    
    style A fill:#ffcc80
    style G fill:#4caf50
```

#### Rules

**Do's:**
- ✅ Start on time, end on time
- ✅ Stand up (keeps it short)
- ✅ Focus on Sprint Goal
- ✅ Be specific and concise
- ✅ Raise impediments

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Solve problems (take offline)
- ❌ Status report to Scrum Master
- ❌ Discuss unrelated topics
- ❌ Let it exceed 15 minutes
- ❌ Skip if people are absent

#### Example Daily Scrum

**Developer 1 (Frontend):**
```
Yesterday: Completed attendance UI mockup and got PO approval
Today: Start implementing attendance form in React
Impediments: None
```

**Developer 2 (Backend):**
```
Yesterday: Created database schema for attendance, started API endpoint
Today: Finish API endpoint, write unit tests
Impediments: None
```

**Developer 3 (Full-Stack):**
```
Yesterday: Worked on authentication integration
Today: Continue integration, then help with attendance validation
Impediments: Waiting for email service API key from IT
```

**Scrum Master:** *Notes impediment, will follow up with IT*

#### Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Status Report** | Talking to Scrum Master, not team | Focus on team synchronization |
| **Problem Solving** | Spending 30 minutes debugging | Take detailed discussions offline |
| **Manager Interrogation** | Manager asks probing questions | Manager observes silently |
| **Missing Team Members** | Not everyone attends | Make attendance mandatory |
| **No Preparation** | People don't know what to say | Review work before standup |

**Example Demo Script:**

```
"In this sprint, our goal was to enable teachers to track attendance.
Let me show you what we built:

[Screen: Teacher Dashboard]
1. As Mrs. Smith, I log in and see my classes
2. I click on 'Math 101-A' and see today's class roster
3. I quickly mark attendance:
   - Present (green checkmark)
   - Absent (red X)
   - Late (yellow clock)
4. I click 'Save' and it's recorded immediately
5. [Switch to parent view] Mr. Jones receives instant notification
6. [Show attendance history] Teachers can view past attendance

This took us from 20 minutes per class to under 2 minutes.
Teachers have saved 18 minutes per class this week."
```

**3. Stakeholder Discussion (45 minutes)**

Questions to facilitate:
- What do you like about this increment?
- What could be improved?
- What's missing?
- What should we prioritize next?
- Any market changes we should consider?

**4. Product Owner Previews Next Sprint (15 minutes)**
- Likely backlog items for next sprint
- Any priority changes
- Updated release plan

#### Sprint Review Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **No Stakeholders** | Missing feedback opportunity | Actively invite stakeholders |
| **Lecture Not Demo** | Talking about work vs. showing | Demo working software |
| **Not Done = Demo** | Showing incomplete work | Only demo "Done" items |
| **No Discussion** | One-way presentation | Engage stakeholders actively |
| **Blame Session** | Finger-pointing about unmet goals | Focus on learning |

### Event 5: Sprint Retrospective

#### Purpose
**Inspect how the last Sprint went and create a plan for improvements.**

#### Duration
- **2-week sprint:** 1.5 hours maximum
- **4-week sprint:** 3 hours maximum

#### Participants
- Scrum Team only (PO, SM, Dev Team)
- Safe environment, no outsiders

#### The Three Questions

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Sprint Retrospective] --> B[What Went Well?<br/>Celebrate Successes]
    A --> C[What Didn't Go Well?<br/>Identify Problems]
    A --> D[What Will We Improve?<br/>Action Items]
    
    B --> E[Continue These<br/>Practices]
    C --> F[Address These<br/>Issues]
    D --> G[Concrete Actions<br/>for Next Sprint]
    
    style A fill:#ce93d8
    style G fill:#4caf50
```

#### Retrospective Techniques

**1. Start-Stop-Continue**

| Start | Stop | Continue |
|-------|------|----------|
| Pair programming on complex tasks | Working overtime | Daily code reviews |
| Automated integration tests | Meetings after 4pm | Team lunches |
| Tech talks (1 hour/week) | Skipping test writing | Documentation updates |

**2. Mad-Sad-Glad**

```mermaid

    A[Mad<br/>Frustrations] --> B[Bug caused<br/>production incident]
    A --> C[Unclear requirements<br/>caused rework]
    
    D[Sad<br/>Disappointments] --> E[Couldn't complete<br/>all sprint items]

    style A fill:#ef5350
    style D fill:#ff9800
    style F fill:#4caf50
```

**3. 4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)**

**Example School System Sprint Retrospective:**

```
LIKED:
- Sprint planning was efficient (1 hour under time)
- Product Owner very responsive to questions
- Good collaboration between frontend and backend

LEARNED:
- Database indexing significantly improves query performance
- Writing tests first (TDD) actually saves time
- Breaking large stories into smaller ones helps

LACKED:
- Clear definition of "Done" caused confusion
- Staging environment was unstable
- Documentation was outdated

LONGED FOR:
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Better test data in staging
- More pair programming opportunities
```

#### Creating Action Items

**SMART Action Items:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Action Item] --> B[Specific:<br/>Clear description]
    A --> C[Measurable:<br/>Know when done]
    A --> D[Assignable:<br/>Someone owns it]
    A --> E[Realistic:<br/>Can be done]
    A --> F[Time-bound:<br/>By next retro]
    
    style A fill:#9c27b0
    style B fill:#ba68c8
    style C fill:#ba68c8
    style D fill:#ba68c8
    style E fill:#ba68c8
    style F fill:#ba68c8
```

**Good Action Items:**
- ✅ "John will document Definition of Done by Wednesday"
- ✅ "Team will do mob programming session on Friday for complex bug"
- ✅ "Sarah will set up automated tests in CI pipeline by end of sprint"

**Bad Action Items:**
- ❌ "We should communicate better" (not specific)
- ❌ "Fix the deployment process" (no owner)
- ❌ "Be more agile" (not measurable)

#### Example Retrospective Action Items

```
Sprint 4 Retrospective Action Items:

1. [John] Create and share Definition of Done checklist by Wednesday
   Status: Open | Due: Jan 10

2. [Sarah] Set up automated deployment to staging by end of sprint
   Status: Open | Due: Jan 17

3. [Team] Hold 30-minute mob programming session Friday for complex bugs
   Status: Open | Recurring: Every Friday 2pm

4. [Mike] Schedule training on React hooks for team
   Status: Open | Due: Jan 15

5. [Scrum Master] Add "Review last retro actions" to next Sprint Planning agenda
   Status: Open | Due: Next sprint planning
```

#### Retrospective Prime Directive

**Read at start of every retrospective:**

> "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."
> — Norm Kerth

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates psychological safety
- Focuses on learning, not blame
- Encourages honesty
- Builds trust

#### Retrospective Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Skip Retrospective** | Miss improvement opportunity | Never skip, it's mandatory |
| **No Actions** | Just talk, no change | Always create 1-3 action items |
| **Same Issues Every Time** | Not following through | Review previous actions |
| **Blame Game** | Focus on individuals | Focus on process/system |
| **Management Present** | Team not honest | Scrum Team only |
| **Too Many Actions** | Nothing gets done | Limit to 1-3 most important |

## 📏 Estimation in Scrum

### Why Estimate?

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Estimation] --> B[Planning<br/>How much work<br/>fits in sprint?]
    A --> C[Forecasting<br/>When will<br/>features be ready?]
    A --> D[Prioritization<br/>Effort vs.<br/>value trade-offs]
    A --> E[Tracking<br/>Monitor<br/>velocity]
    
    style A fill:#9c27b0
```

### Story Points

#### What Are Story Points?

**Story Points** are a unit of measure for expressing the relative effort required to implement a user story.

**Story Points Consider:**
- **Complexity:** How hard is it?
- **Effort:** How much work?
- **Uncertainty:** How clear is it?
- **Risk:** What could go wrong?

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Story Points] --> B[Complexity<br/>Technical difficulty]
    A --> C[Effort<br/>Amount of work]
    A --> D[Uncertainty<br/>Unknowns]
    A --> E[Risk<br/>What could go wrong]
    
    B --> F[Relative<br/>Estimate]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F
    
    style A fill:#ff9800
    style F fill:#4caf50
```

#### Modified Fibonacci Sequence

**Common Scale:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100

**Why Fibonacci?**
- Reflects increasing uncertainty
- Forces meaningful distinctions
- Prevents false precision

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[1 point<br/>Trivial] --> B[2 points<br/>Simple]
    B --> C[3 points<br/>Moderate]
    C --> D[5 points<br/>Average]
    D --> E[8 points<br/>Complex]
    E --> F[13 points<br/>Very Complex]
    F --> G[20+ points<br/>Too Large<br/>Split It!]
    
    style A fill:#c8e6c9
    style D fill:#fff9c4
    style G fill:#ef5350
```

#### Reference Stories

**School System Reference Stories:**

| Points | Story | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **1** | Change button color | Simple CSS change, 15 minutes |
| **2** | Add new validation rule | Straightforward logic, well-understood |
| **3** | Add search filter | Standard feature, known patterns |
| **5** | Create new dashboard widget | Medium complexity, some unknowns |
| **8** | Implement attendance tracking | Complex business logic, integration |
| **13** | Build grade calculation engine | Very complex, multiple rules, testing |
| **20** | Complete reporting module | Too large, should be split |

### Planning Poker

#### The Process

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[1. Product Owner<br/>Reads Story] --> B[2. Team Asks<br/>Questions]
    B --> C[3. Team Discusses<br/>Briefly]
    C --> D[4. Everyone Selects<br/>Card Privately]
    D --> E[5. Reveal<br/>Simultaneously]
    E --> F{Consensus?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Record Estimate]
    F -->|No| H[High & Low<br/>Explain Reasoning]
    H --> I[Brief Discussion]
    I --> D
    
    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style D fill:#fff9c4
    style F fill:#ff9800
    style G fill:#4caf50
```

#### Planning Poker Example

**Story:** US-024 Parent Notification for Absences

**Round 1:**
- Developer 1: Shows **5**
- Developer 2: Shows **8**
- Developer 3: Shows **5**
- Developer 4: Shows **13**

**Developer 4 (13) explains:**
"I'm concerned about the SMS gateway integration. We've never done that before, and there might be complications with retry logic and error handling."

**Developer 2 (8) explains:**
"The notification part is straightforward—we already have email working. But I agree SMS adds complexity."

**Team Discussion:** 
Clarify that SMS gateway is already set up (DevOps confirmed). Team now better understands scope.

**Round 2:**
- Developer 1: Shows **5**
- Developer 2: Shows **5**
- Developer 3: Shows **5**
- Developer 4: Shows **5**

**Consensus:** 5 points ✓

#### Planning Poker Benefits

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Planning<br/>Poker))

      Trigger important discussions
      Reveal hidden complexity
    Quick Consensus
      Usually 1-2 rounds
      Fun and engaging
      Efficient process
    Shared Understanding
      Everyone learns from discussion
      Knowledge spreads
      Better estimates over time
```

### Velocity

#### What is Velocity?

**Velocity** is the amount of work a team completes in a sprint, measured in story points.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Sprint 1:<br/>35 points] --> B[Sprint 2:<br/>38 points]
    B --> C[Sprint 3:<br/>42 points]
    C --> D[Sprint 4:<br/>40 points]
    D --> E[Average Velocity:<br/>38.75 points]
    
    style E fill:#4caf50
```

#### Calculating Velocity

**Example School System:**

| Sprint | Committed | Completed | Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Sprint 1 | 40 | 35 | 35 |
| Sprint 2 | 40 | 38 | 38 |
| Sprint 3 | 42 | 42 | 42 |
| Sprint 4 | 45 | 40 | 40 |
| Sprint 5 | 43 | 43 | 43 |
| **Average** | | | **39.6** |

**Use Average Velocity for Planning:**
- Sprint 6 commitment: 38-42 points (safe range)

#### Velocity Trends

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Velocity Trends] --> B[Increasing<br/>Team improving,<br/>learning domain]
    A --> C[Stable<br/>Predictable,<br/>sustainable pace]
    A --> D[Decreasing<br/>Technical debt,<br/>quality issues]
    A --> E[Volatile<br/>Unstable estimates,<br/>external disruptions]
    
    style B fill:#4caf50
    style C fill:#81c784
    style D fill:#ef5350
    style E fill:#ff9800
```

#### Using Velocity for Forecasting

**Remaining Backlog:** 200 story points  
**Average Velocity:** 40 points/sprint  
**Forecast:** 200 ÷ 40 = **5 sprints** (10 weeks)

**Release Planning:**

```mermaid
gantt
    title Release Plan Based on Velocity
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Completed
    Sprint 1-5 Complete    :done, s1, 2025-01-01, 10w
    section Forecasted
    Sprint 6              :s6, 2025-03-12, 2w
    Sprint 7              :s7, after s6, 2w
    Sprint 8              :s8, after s7, 2w
    Sprint 9              :s9, after s8, 2w
    Sprint 10 - Release   :crit, s10, after s9, 2w
```

#### Velocity Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't:**

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Bad | Correct Approach |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Compare Team Velocities** | Different contexts, scales | Each team has own velocity |
| **Pressure to Increase** | Gaming system, quality drops | Focus on sustainable pace |
| **Count Incomplete Work** | Inflates velocity artificially | Only count Done items |
| **Performance Metric** | Creates perverse incentives | Use for planning only |
| **Expect Instant Stability** | Takes 3-5 sprints to stabilize | Allow learning period |
