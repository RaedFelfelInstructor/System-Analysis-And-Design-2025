## Essential Takeaways

### 1. User-Centered Design

**Remember:** "You are not your user."

- Research before designing
- Test with real users
- Iterate based on feedback

### 2. Information Architecture Drives Navigation

Good IA makes content findable:
- Organize by user mental models
- Use clear, consistent labels
- Keep hierarchy shallow (3 levels max)

### 3. Wireframes Before Code

Wireframes save time and money:
- Start low-fidelity, add detail as needed
- Include all states (loading, error, empty)
- Annotate behaviors

### 4. Design Principles Create Consistency

Apply consistently:
- Proximity groups related elements
- Hierarchy guides attention
- Feedback confirms actions

### 5. Accessibility is Essential

Not optional—it's required:
- 4.5:1 color contrast
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- 44px touch targets

### 6. Mobile-First is the Standard

Design for constraints:
- Mobile first, then enhance
- Touch-friendly targets
- Responsive patterns

### 7. Test Early and Often

Validation prevents waste:
- 5 users find 80% of issues
- Heuristic evaluation for quick feedback
- Severity ratings prioritize fixes

## Quick Reference Card

### Nielsen's 10 Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match real world
3. User control & freedom
4. Consistency & standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition over recall
7. Flexibility & efficiency
8. Aesthetic & minimal
9. Error recovery
10. Help & documentation

### POUR Principles (Accessibility)

- **P**erceivable - Can users perceive content?
- **O**perable - Can users operate the interface?
- **U**nderstandable - Can users understand it?
- **R**obust - Does it work with assistive tech?

### Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Touch target minimum | 44 x 44 px |
| Color contrast (normal text) | 4.5:1 |
| Color contrast (large text) | 3:1 |
| Users for usability testing | 5 |
| Navigation depth max | 3 levels |

## Chapter Quiz

### Multiple Choice

**1. What is the main difference between UI and UX?**
- a) UI is mobile, UX is desktop
- b) UI is visual elements, UX is overall experience
- c) UI is for developers, UX is for designers
- d) They are the same thing

<details><summary>Answer</summary>b) UI is the visual elements users see and interact with. UX is the overall experience, including usability, accessibility, and satisfaction.</details>

**2. Which principle states that elements close together are perceived as related?**
- a) Similarity
- b) Closure
- c) Proximity
- d) Continuity

<details><summary>Answer</summary>c) Proximity - grouping related items together helps users understand relationships.</details>

**3. What is the minimum color contrast ratio for normal text (WCAG AA)?**
- a) 2:1
- b) 3:1
- c) 4.5:1
- d) 7:1

<details><summary>Answer</summary>c) 4.5:1 for normal text. Large text (18px+) requires 3:1.</details>

**4. In mobile-first design, you start with:**
- a) Desktop layout, then remove features for mobile
- b) Mobile layout, then add features for desktop
- c) Tablet layout, then adjust for both
- d) All layouts simultaneously

<details><summary>Answer</summary>b) Mobile first means designing for the smallest screen with essential features, then progressively enhancing for larger screens.</details>

**5. How many users typically find 80% of usability issues?**
- a) 1
- b) 3
- c) 5
- d) 10

<details><summary>Answer</summary>c) 5 users. Research shows this is the optimal number for iterative usability testing.</details>

### True or False

**6. Wireframes should include all color and typography details.**
<details><summary>Answer</summary>False. Wireframes focus on structure and layout, not visual design details.</details>

**7. Accessibility benefits only users with disabilities.**
<details><summary>Answer</summary>False. Accessibility benefits everyone—captions help in noisy environments, large buttons help on mobile, clear language helps non-native speakers.</details>

**8. Heuristic evaluation requires recruiting real users.**
<details><summary>Answer</summary>False. Heuristic evaluation is done by experts reviewing against established principles. User testing requires real users.</details>

### Short Answer

**9. List three things that should be included in wireframe annotations.**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
- Interaction behaviors (what happens when clicked)
- Data sources (where information comes from)
- Edge cases (empty states, errors, long content)
- Responsive behavior
- Business rules
</details>

**10. What does POUR stand for in accessibility?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust
</details>
