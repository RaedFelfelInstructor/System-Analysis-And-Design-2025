# Chapter 3: Use Case Modeling and User Stories

**Course:** SA2025 - Software Analysis and Design  
**Chapter Duration:** 6-7 hours (4 hours instruction + 2-3 hours hands-on)  
**Prerequisites:** Chapter 2 - Requirements Gathering and Analysis

---

## 📋 Chapter Overview

Welcome to Chapter 3! Now that you've learned how to gather and document requirements, it's time to model **how users interact with the system**. This chapter bridges the gap between requirements and design by showing you how to:

- Visualize system behavior from the user's perspective
- Create use case diagrams using UML notation
- Write detailed use case descriptions with alternative flows
- Transform requirements into user stories
- Build story maps for agile development

**Why This Matters:**
- Use cases help developers understand WHAT users need to do
- User stories drive agile development sprints
- These models become the foundation for system design, testing, and documentation
- Employers value analysts who can translate business needs into clear behavioral specifications

1. **Identify Actors and Use Cases** from system requirements
